<h1>
  The King
  </h1>
<p>
  The King had ruled over his land,
  he did so with a heavy hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each day he sat upon his throne, he felt incredibly alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    A feeling that he couldn't stand, it made his life terribly bland.
  </p>
  <p>
    But one day came along a girl, as pretty as a pearl.
  </p>
  <p>
    She would later become his wife, and they would live a happy life.
