    <h1>The King</h1>
    <p>
      The King had ruled over his land, he did so with a heavy hand.<br />
      Each day he sat upon his throne, he felt incredibly alone.<br />
      A feeling that he couldn't stand, it made his life terribly bland.<br />
      But one day came along a girl, as pretty as a pearl.<br />
      She would later become his wife, and they would live a happy life.
